    \begin{frame}{Where is it used?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<1-> The delay-locked loop (DLL) is a circuit that is used to align the phase of a clock signal with the phase of a reference signal.
            \item<2-> The DLL is used in applications where the phase of the clock signal is critical, such as in high-speed communication systems.
            \item<3-> Where you need a \alert<3>{PVT robust} clock distribution.
        \end{itemize}
